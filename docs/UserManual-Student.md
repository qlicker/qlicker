## Logging In Through Your Institution
If your institution has integrated Qlicker with their single sign-on, click 'Login Through SSO'. This will take you to the institution's sign-on page.

If your institution has not linked Qlicker with single sign-on, you wil have to create an account manually. 

## Creating an Account
To create an account, go to the Qlicker login page and click 'Create an Account'.

Enter the following information (* indicates mandatory fields):
+ **First Name** 
+ **Last Name** 
+ ***Email**: Enter your academic email here.
+ ***Password** 

Once all the details are entered, click 'Sign Up'. You will be redirected to the Qlicker home page. Be sure to check your email to verify your Qlicker account.

## Enrolling in Courses
To enroll in a course, you must receive a 6-digit alphanumeric code from a Professor. On the Qlicker home page, enter the enrolment code in the textbox at the top of the page and click 'Enroll in Course'. The course will display on the page once enrolment is successful. 

![Enrollment Textbox](images/student/enroll_course.png)

Each course can be accessed by clicking on the courses heading in the Qlicker home page, or by selecting the desired course under "Courses" in the navigation bar. 

In each courses page, you can submit questions, access Live sessions, and view results of Finished sessions. 

## Submitting Questions
Student questions submissions can only be done in a specific course. To submit a question, select a course from either the Qlicker home page or through the navigation bar. Select 'Question Library' from the navigation bar. This will bring you to your question library, where you can view your questions, public questions in the course, and questions shared with you. Click 'New Question' from the sidebar in your library, and fill in the question edit form.

![Question Edit](images/student/submit_question.png)

+ **Duplicate:** This makes a copy of the question.
+ **Delete:** This deletes the question.
+ **Share:** This brings up the sharing form. You can share questions with another user by entering their Qlicker email, or share with yourself to use across courses.
+ **Private:** By default your question will show up in the students submissions of your instructor(s). Check this box to hide the question.
+ **Public:** If your professor has enabled unapproved public questions, then you will see another checkbox labeled 'Public'. Your question will be automatically shown in the public questions to all users in the course. Uncheck this box to not show.
+ **Question Field:** This is where the question text is entered. The text can be modified using the toolbar above the field.
+ **Answers:** There are four different questions types; multiple choice, multi-select, true or false, and short answer. For multiple choice and multi-select, there can be a max of 6 answers to choose from. Like question text, the answers can be modified using the toollbar. Correct and Incorrect options can be toggled by clicking on the checkbox to the right of each answer.
+ **Solution:** This is where the full solution to your question is placed. The text here can also be modified using the toolbar.

## Sessions
Students can only participate in Live sessions. When a Live session shows up either on the Qlicker home page or the course's page, select it to join the session. 

![Live Session](images/student/live_session.png)

Professors have the ability to hide questions or disallow responses, so please listen to the Professor for details for each session.

When a question is active, you can answer it by selecting a multiple choice or true/false option, selecting multiple options if the question is multi-select, or entering text in a field if the question is short answer. Once an option is selected, the 'Submit' button will be enabled. To submit your selection, click on the 'Submit' button. You cannot change an answer after submitting it. After clicking 'Submit', a success message will show up, and the button will say 'Submitted'. 

## Checking Participation
After finishing a session, the session will show up under the course's page as Finished. Sessions which are marked as reviewable will be coloured white, while unreviewable sessions are marked in red. Select a Finished session to view participation grades.

![Finished Session](images/student/finished_session.png)

The statistics are number of answers submitted based on the questions asked in the session. 

You can also view participation across all sessions by selecting 'Grades' from the navigation bar.
