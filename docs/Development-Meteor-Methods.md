# Meteor Methods - API Overview

All backend functionality is implemented using meteor methods ([https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html](https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html)). All methods are documented using JSDoc. Below are links to JSDocs that can also be found in the `docs/jsdocs` folder in this repo.
